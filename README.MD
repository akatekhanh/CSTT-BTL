#  K-Shorest path problem

## How to run it
```bash
python k_shortest.py
```

#  Labeling connected-component problem

## How it works
Given an binary array/image which is a matrix with the value 1 - 0
Label all group of 1 value as index. 
(Labelling connected-component problem)
The implement is for classical algorithm.

** The test.txt file contain an 9x17 array for testing purpose
** The test_bw.png is for demo.

## How to run it
```bash
python labelling_component.py
```
